# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in C. Below is a list of sorting algorithms included along with a brief description of each.

## 1. Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## 2. Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It iterates through the input elements, removing one element from the input data, finding the location it belongs to in the sorted list, and inserting it there.

## 3. Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it at the beginning.

## 4. Quick Sort

Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the chosen pivot.

## 5. Shell Sort

Shell Sort is an optimization over insertion sort that starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other and progressively reduces the gap between elements to be compared.

## 6. Cocktail Shaker Sort

Cocktail Shaker Sort, also known as Bidirectional Bubble Sort, is a variation of the Bubble Sort algorithm that sorts the list in both directions.

## 7. Counting Sort

Counting Sort is an integer sorting algorithm that operates by counting the number of occurrences of each unique element in the input array.

## 8. Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, sorts each half separately, and then merges the sorted halves.

## 9. Heap Sort

Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that transforms the input array into a heap, then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and rebuilds the heap until the array is sorted.

## 10. Radix Sort

Radix Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts numbers by processing individual digits.

## 11. Bitonic Sort

Bitonic Sort is a parallel sorting algorithm that works by dividing the input sequence into two parts, creating a bitonic sequence, and then sorting each part recursively.

## 12. Quick Sort - Hoare Partition scheme

Quick Sort with Hoare Partition scheme is a variation of Quick Sort that uses a different partitioning scheme to choose the pivot element.

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in [language], you can find the implementation in the corresponding directory.
